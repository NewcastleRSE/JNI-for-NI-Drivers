JNI Interface for National Instruments Drivers. National Instruments does not currently provide language interfaces for Java.

It includes some sample code for doing some of the most common tasks such as creating a task, outputting a digital signal and reading an analogue input.

This is a work in progress and should be available very soon (hopefully before Christmas).
