# JNI-for-NI-Drivers
JNI Interface for National Instruments Drivers. National Instruments does not currently provide language interfaces for Java. This package is a DLL wrapper using Java Native Interface for National Instruments drivers. It includes the DLL wrapper and some sample code for doing some of the most common NI tasks such as creating a task, outputting a digital signal and reading an analogue input.

National instruments describe the problem:

As the package uses JNI, it is platform dependent and only works on windows systems.

This is a work in progress and should be available very soon (hopefully before Christmas, definitely before end of Feb/16).
